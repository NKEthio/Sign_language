## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Google Account (for Google Colab)
- Basic Python knowledge (helpful but not required)
- No installation needed - runs entirely in Google Colab!

### Quick Start

1. **Open the Notebook**
   - Click on `ASL_Interpreter_Educational.ipynb`
   - Click "Open in Colab" button at the top

2. **Set Up GPU**
   - In Colab: `Runtime` ‚Üí `Change runtime type` ‚Üí Select `GPU`

3. **Run the Notebook**
   - Execute cells in order by pressing `Shift + Enter`
   - Follow the detailed instructions in each section

## üìä Dataset Specifications

The project uses the **Sign Language MNIST** dataset:

- **Format**: CSV files with pixel values
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels (grayscale)
- **Classes**: 25 letters (A-Z excluding J and Z, which require motion)
- **Training Samples**: 27,455 images
- **Test Samples**: 7,172 images
- **Source**: Available via direct download in the notebook

### Why These Specifications?

- **28x28 pixels**: Standardized size for efficient processing
- **Grayscale**: Reduces complexity while maintaining recognition accuracy
- **Excluding J and Z**: These letters require motion, beyond static image recognition
- **Balanced dataset**: Each letter has approximately equal representation
